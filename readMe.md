This is a simple way to start to build a discord bot. All you have to do is just
add commands and Slash Commands to the appropriate folders . Also remeber to add
BOT_TOKEN, GUILD_ID, and CLIENT_ID. Run npm deploy to deploy to deploy the slash
commands to the server.

Still have to add embeds. Have to add comments.

Also have database or cache mode

Like on vs once add a dev so only use that during deelopment guild ocmmands
